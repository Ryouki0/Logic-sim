# Logic Gate Simulator
## Overview
-**Description**: A simple logic gate simulator, made with react.

## Key features
- **Create bigger components**: Start with 'AND', 'NO' and 'DELAY' gates. From these gates create bigger components.
- **Connect gates together**: Connect the inputs and outputs of the gates together, to form more complex circuits.
- **Real time simulation**: Run the simulation at a user specified hertz.

## Architecture

### Graph theory & circuit representation
- **Circuits as graphs**: In this simulation, there are two types of graphs that can be created using logic gates - directed acyclic graphs (DAG), and strongly connected components (SCC)
